# Schedule Planner

## Description

My project can be viewed [here](https://mcktayl.github.io/schedule-planner/).

The schedule planner allows the user to save their daily plans to local storage so that it will remain upon refreshing/reloading. This project can increase time management and organization, leading to higher productivity overall.

## Installation

This application runs in the browser and requires no installation by the user.

## Usage

A video demonstration can be viewed [here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91210267/139353420-cd6dc8ce-652c-4f55-aeba-cbcefda2d034.mp4).

Upon loading, the user is presented with the date and a series of time blocks in which to write their plans/appointments. The blocks are color coded according to the hour (grey when that hour has passed, red when currently in that hour, and green if that hour is in the future). The user can click "save" to save the text entered in that hour to local storage.
